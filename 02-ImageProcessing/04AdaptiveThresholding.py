 # A global value as threshold value may not be good in all the conditions where image has different lighting conditions in different areas. 
 # In that case, we go for adaptive thresholding. 
 # In this, the algorithm calculate the threshold for a small regions of the image. 
 # So we get different thresholds for different regions of the same image and it gives us better results for images with varying illumination.

# It has three special input params and only one output argument.

# Adaptive Method - It decides how thresholding value is calculated.
# cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C : threshold value is the mean of neighbourhood area.
# cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C : threshold value is the weighted sum of neighbourhood values where weights are a gaussian window.
# Block Size - It decides the size of neighbourhood area.

# C - It is just a constant which is subtracted from the mean or weighted mean calculated.

# Below piece of code compares global thresholding and adaptive thresholding for an image with varying illumination:
